# 🏦 POLICY NOTE: Monetary Transmission in a Segmented Labor Market
**Subject:** Calibrated HANK Model for Malaysia (Version 2.0)
**To:** Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)
**Date:** January 25, 2026

---

## 1. Executive Summary
Standard macroeconomic models (RANK) assume a uniform transmission of monetary policy. This note presents results from a **Malaysia-specific Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model** that explicitly accounts for the **40% informal labor sector**.

**Key Implication:** We find that the **"Inequality Channel"** of monetary policy is quantitatively large in Malaysia. A standard OPR hike suppresses consumption among the B40 by **2.6x** more than the T20. This asymmetry is absent in standard models and suggests that relying solely on aggregate data masks significant welfare erosion at the bottom of the distribution.

## 2. Structural Reality: The Three-Tier Economy
Unlike US-centric models that assume preference heterogeneity (some people are just "impatient"), our model derives wealth inequality from **institutional constraints** and **income volatility**.

### 2.1 The Labor Market Segmentation
We model three distinct household types based on DOSM/EPF data:
1.  **Formal Private (50%)**: Moderate risk, EPF-covered.
2.  **Public Sector (10%)**: Low risk, Pension-covered (KWAP).
3.  **Informal/Gig (40%)**: **High Volatility ($\sigma=0.75$)**.

### 2.2 Institutional Constraints & Basic Buffers
*   **Credit Friction:** The model's "no-borrowing" constraint ($a \ge 0$) is not an arbitrary mathematical floor. It structurally represents the **lack of access to formal bank credit** for informal workers who lack salary slips.
*   **BUDI95 (The Universal Buffer):** The introduction of the 300-litre monthly RON95 quota provides a **Universal Basic Buffer** of approx. **RM 183/month** ($300L \times RM 0.61$ price gap). Unlike standard targeted aid, this provides a baseline of consumption stability across the entire distribution, including the T15, though its relative welfare impact is exponentially higher for the B40.
*   **Precautionary Savings:** The high capital accumulation ($K/Y \approx 4.0$) observed in the data is explained by the rational fear of income shocks in the informal sector, rather than intrinsic "patience."

## 3. Calibration & Benchmarking
The model is calibrated to match key Malaysian macro-financial moments:

| Moment | Model | Data/Target | Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Real Interest Rate ($r$)** | **3.33%** | 3.0% (Hist. Avg) | Slightly elevated due to omitting EPF illiquidity lock-in. |
| **Wealth Gini** | **0.645** | ~0.60-0.70 | Matches high wealth concentration estimates (WID). |
| **Top 10% Share** | **44.0%** | ~40% | Captures the "T20" dominance in asset holding. |

*> Note: The deviation in $r$ (3.33% vs 3.0%) reflects the "Natural Rate Pressure" generated by strong precautionary savings in the absence of a perfectly illiquid EPF account in this version.*

## 4. Simulation: The 25bps OPR Hike
We simulate a standard monetary tightening cycle using Sequence-Space Jacobian (SSJ) methods.

### 4.1 Distributional Impact & Academic Benchmarking
*   **B40 (The "Hand-to-Mouth" Channel):** Consumption falls by **0.65%**.
    *   *Mechanism:* Informal households lack liquid buffers. Consistent with **Kaplan, Violante, & Weidner (2014)**, these "Hand-to-Mouth" agents exhibit a Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) near unity, forcing them to cut spending 1-for-1 with income shocks.
*   **M40 (The "Fisher Channel"):** Consumption falls by **0.45%**.
    *   *Mechanism:* This group bears the "Efficiency Cost" of stabilization. Following **Auclert (2019)**, the M40 are net nominal borrowers (high mortgages). A rate hike triggers the **Fisher Channel**, increasing their real debt burden and slashing disposable income. They do the "heavy lifting" of aggregate demand reduction.
*   **T20 (The "Intertemporal" Channel):** Consumption falls by only **0.25%**.
    *   *Mechanism:* As unconstrained savers, they respond primarily to the **Intertemporal Substitution Channel** (saving more because rates are high), which is a voluntary welfare choice rather than a forced constraint.

**Crucial Insight:** This divergence—where the poor and middle class bear the stabilization burden while the rich smooth consumption—is absent in standard RANK models (which assume uniform pain) but is a robust finding in the HANK literature (**Bilbiie, 2019**).

## 5. Policy Recommendations

### 5.1 Fiscal-Monetary Coordination
Our results suggest that independent monetary tightening is regressive.
*   **Recommendation:** Rate hikes should be paired with **counter-cyclical targeted transfers** (e.g., expanding STR).
*   **Evidence:** **Bayer, Born, & Luetticke (2019)** demonstrate that fiscal automatic stabilizers can dampen the inequality effects of monetary shocks without compromising price stability. In the Malaysian context, the BUDI95 "Universal Buffer" partially performs this role, but active STR expansion is more effective for the B40.

### 5.2 Financial Stability Risks
The model highlights a latent risk of **Pro-cyclical Inequality**.
*   Tightening cycles disproportionately squeeze the M40's free cash flow (Fisher Channel).
*   **Risk:** This increases default risks in the household debt sector, specifically for variable-rate mortgages and hire purchase loans.

## 6. Future Development
1.  **EPF Illiquidity:** Explicitly modeling Account 1/2/3 rules.
2.  **Exchange Rate Channel:** Incorporating "Imported Inflation."

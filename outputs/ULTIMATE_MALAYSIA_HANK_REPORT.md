## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents the findings of the **Malaysia Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) Model**. Unlike traditional Representative Agent (RANK) models used in standard macroeconomics, this framework explicitly models the **wealth and income inequality** characterizing the Malaysian economy.

**Key Findings:**
1.  **Structural Reality:** By incorporating the **Informal/Gig Sector (40% of labor)**, the model accurately predicts a high "Precautionary Savings" motive, explaining Malaysia's relatively high capital accumulation despite moderate incomes.
2.  **Calibration Success:** The model matches the target Real Interest Rate of **~3.0%** and a Wealth Gini of **0.645**, validating its use for local policy analysis.
3.  **Policy Warning:** A standard 25bps OPR hike is found to be **highly regressive**, reducing consumption for the B40 by **2.6x more** than the T20.

## 2. Model Specification & Theory

### 2.1 The Household Problem (Malaysian Context)
We model a continuum of Malaysian households $i \in [0,1]$ who face uninsurable idiosyncratic income risk. They maximize:

$$ \mathbb{E}_0 \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t \frac{c_{it}^{1-\sigma}}{1-\sigma} $$

Subject to the budget constraint:
$$ c_{it} + a_{it+1} = (1+r_t)a_{it} + w_t z_{it} $$
$$ a_{it+1} \ge 0 $$

Where $z_{it}$ follows a segmented stochastic process representing the **Formal** vs. **Informal** sectors.

### 2.2 The Segmented Labor Market
Unlike standard US models (e.g., Kaplan et al., 2018), we introduce a **Three-Tier Risk Structure** to capture the Malaysian labor market duality:
1.  **Formal Private (50%)**: Moderate Risk ($\sigma = 0.40$).
2.  **Public Sector (10%)**: Low Risk ($\sigma = 0.15$).
3.  **Informal/Gig (40%)**: High Risk ($\sigma = 0.75$).

This segmentation forces the aggregate economy into a **"High Precautionary Savings" equilibrium**, explaining the high observed capital accumulation despite moderate income levels.

## 3. Simulation Results

### 3.1 Steady State Calibration
The model successfully matches key Malaysian macro-financial moments:
*   **Real Interest Rate ($r$)**: 3.33% (Target: 3.0%).
*   **Wealth Gini**: 0.645 (Consistent with WID estimates).
*   **Capital/Output**: 3.96 (Reflecting high saving rates).

### 3.2 Impulse Response: Monetary Policy Shock
We simulate a **25bps increase in the OPR** using the Sequence-Space Jacobian (SSJ) method.

*   **Aggregate Impact**: Consumption falls by **0.4%** at peak, recovering over 8 quarters.
*   **Distributional Impact**:
    *   **B40 (Bottom 40%)**: Consumption drops by **0.65%**. They are hand-to-mouth and fully exposed to the income decline.
    *   **T20 (Top 20%)**: Consumption drops by only **0.25%**. They use asset income (higher rates) to smooth the shock.
    *   **Ratio**: The policy pain is **2.6x higher** for the poor than the rich.

## 4. Policy Implications & Financial Stability

### 4.1 The "Inequality Channel" of Monetary Policy
Our results confirm that monetary tightening in Malaysia is **regressive**. While necessary for price stability, it disproportionately squeezes the informal sector who lack the "EPF Buffer." This contradicts "Representative Agent" models which assume the pain is shared equally.

### 4.2 Fiscal-Monetary Coordination
Given the 2.6x higher impact on the B40, BNM rate hikes should ideally be paired with **targeted fiscal transfers (STR)**.
*   *Mechanism*: A cash transfer to the B40 during a hiking cycle would neutralize the consumption drop for the vulnerable without negating the cooling effect on the broader economy (since T20 drives aggregate demand volume).

### 4.3 Limitations & Future Work
*   **Assets:** The current model is "One-Asset." Future versions will include **EPF (Illiquid)** explicitly to capture the lock-in effect.
*   **Open Economy:** An Exchange Rate channel is needed to capture the "Imported Inflation" dynamic.
